# Predicting Bike-Sharing Data (Your First Neural Network)

In this real project, I built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, it gave me a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before moving on to higher-level tools such as PyTorch.
